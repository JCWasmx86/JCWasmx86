#### About me
I'm an IT-Security student from somewhere in Europe.

I primarily work on tooling with C and Vala.

Another area of interest of mine is the Language Server Protocol

- Contributed to the [vala-language-server](https://github.com/vala-lang/vala-language-server)
- Wrote a basic Meson language server called [MesonLSP](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/mesonlsp_vala)
- Wrote a Meson language server superseding MesonLSP called [Swift-MesonLSP](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/Swift-MesonLSP)
- Wrote a basic language server for the GTK CSS flavor ([GTKCssLanguageServer](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/GTKCssLanguageServer))
- Contribute a few lines of code to the Swift language server ([sourcekit-lsp](https://github.com/apple/sourcekit-lsp))
- Wrote a proxy language server between lemminx, vscode-json-languageserver and yaml-language-server ([proxy-ls](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/proxy-ls))
