#### About me
I'm a student from somewhere in europe.

I primarily work on tooling around vala, like [vapigen](https://github.com/JCWasmx86/valabindgen), a VAPI-Generator using libclang or sometimes I contribute to the vala-language-server.

Another area of interest of mine is the Language Server Protocol.


#### Technologies/Ecosystems I like
1. Vala
2. C
3. Linux
4. GNOME

#### Non-technical things I like
1. The Lord of the Rings
2. The Silmarillion

# My guidelines

1. Do one thing and do it well.
2. Attempt to upstream all my patches that could be useful.
